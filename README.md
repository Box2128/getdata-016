This document (README.md) identifies the analysis script (run_analysis.R), codebook (codebook.md), and tidy data set that results from running the script (har-smartphone.txt).

Numerous data files from the original data set are contained within the test and train directories. In addition, there are various files (activity_labels.txt, features.txt, features_info.txt) that must remain in the same directory as the analysis script.

**Analysis Script**

Open the script (run_analysis.R) and run the contents of the entire script. The script will output a tidy data set (har-smartphone.txt).

(Note to reader: make sure that you have the dplyr package installed in R prior to running the analysis script. Successful execution of the analysis script depends on the presence of this package.)

**Codebook**

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Open the codebook (codebook.md) to find descriptions of each of the variables in the tidy data set, as well as possible values or ranges of values for each variables.
